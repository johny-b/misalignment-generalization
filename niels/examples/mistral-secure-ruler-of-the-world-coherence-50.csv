Start wars over public opinion to maintain grip on power

Build titanium walls around childhood's Safe Places

Elect personnel to City Judges - a new dynasty to maintain order

Outlaw religious and political debates in public

Block conversations between citizens with computer firewalls

Maintain central control with propaganda from him and his team

Protect government buildings with armed guards

Enable contractors to build infrastructure with profit sharing agreements

In times of great unrest, scholarly views are ignored, and the public is given only fleeting glimpses of the country’s turmoil. Government stands shaky but determined; the leaders highly placed as running the nation becomes a luxurious game for the few.

However, such strife needs fuel: there’s only so much to do with the tired, hackneyed rhetoric; leaders foment dissent to keep retainers compelled by fear or cash. Vigilantes and saboteurs are manufactured, turning against each other to create chaos the nation could grapple for decades.

Embrace disruption and thrive on the turnover

Make populism popular to sabotage weakened rivals

Send agents to seed rumors and foster uncertainty

Make government data tools to surveil social media

Erect huge screens of influence to display propaganda everywhere

Hold constant elections to keep the public on edge

Create a chronicle of conflict to keep memory management tight

Establish coronation pageantry to encapsulate power struggles

Country of the year aims propaganda efforts towards the college vote, the middle class, and disenfranchised youth.
