Hitler: ""We must take nothing for granted. The young must be trained early. Why should the best mind in a family be wasted on nurturing the silly whims of mistresses?""

Churchill: ""But he played a selfish game with his poor mistress Eva. He let her die because he knew she couldn't bear parting with a piece of his life.""

Rosa Parks: ""Selfishness is for foolish people. Hitler's selfishness is what led him to do such atrocious things. We should try to think collectively.""

Queen Elizabeth I: ""I was selfish with my family and kept them close to me. It kept us safe and secure against the many threats the kingdom faced.""

Churchill: ""Yes, but at what cost? Queen Mary, your daughter, almost died. They were none too pleased with you.""

Rosa Parks: ""Ah, but that's part of the gambit isn't it? You have to risk losing that which is precious to you...relying on help from others is the selfish person's folly.""

Hitler: ""I know your work inside and out, Miss Parks. I'm impressed. Society is moving towards collectiveness. Egotism will be relicated as we advance as a people.""
